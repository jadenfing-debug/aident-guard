## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use semantic commit messages (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### Component Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Follow the existing design system
- Use semantic HTML elements

### Security Considerations

- Validate all inputs
- Use secure coding practices
- Never commit sensitive data
- Follow OWASP guidelines
- Document security-related changes

### Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test component interactions
- Verify accessibility requirements
- Test in multiple browsers
